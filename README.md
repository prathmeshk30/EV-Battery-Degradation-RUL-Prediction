# EV-Battery-Degradation-RUL-Prediction
Electric vehicle (EV) performance heavily depends on battery health. Over time, lithium-ion batteries degrade due to repeated charge-discharge cycles, leading to reduced capacity and efficiency.
This project analyzes battery degradation patterns using NASA’s Li-ion dataset and builds predictive models to estimate battery capacity and Remaining Useful Life (RUL), enabling better maintenance and performance optimization.
